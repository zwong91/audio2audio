## Usage

### Without Installation

An unofficial [live demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mrfakename/MeloTTS) is hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

#### Use it on MyShell

There are hundreds of TTS models on MyShell, much more than MeloTTS. See examples [here](https://github.com/myshell-ai/MeloTTS/blob/main/docs/quick_use.md#use-melotts-without-installation).
More can be found at the widget center of [MyShell.ai](https://app.myshell.ai/robot-workshop).

### Install and Use Locally

Follow the installation steps [here](https://github.com/myshell-ai/MeloTTS/blob/main/docs/install.md#linux-and-macos-install) before using the following snippet:

```python
from melo.api import TTS

# Speed is adjustable
speed = 1.0

# CPU is sufficient for real-time inference.
# You can set it manually to 'cpu' or 'cuda' or 'cuda:0' or 'mps'
device = 'auto' # Will automatically use GPU if available

# English 
text = "Did you ever hear a folk tale about a giant turtle?"
model = TTS(language='EN_V2', device=device)
speaker_ids = model.hps.data.spk2id

# American accent
output_path = 'en-us.wav'
model.tts_to_file(text, speaker_ids['EN-US'], output_path, speed=speed)

# British accent
output_path = 'en-br.wav'
model.tts_to_file(text, speaker_ids['EN-BR'], output_path, speed=speed)

# Indian accent
output_path = 'en-india.wav'
model.tts_to_file(text, speaker_ids['EN_INDIA'], output_path, speed=speed)

# Australian accent
output_path = 'en-au.wav'
model.tts_to_file(text, speaker_ids['EN-AU'], output_path, speed=speed)

# Default accent
output_path = 'en-default.wav'
model.tts_to_file(text, speaker_ids['EN-Default'], output_path, speed=speed)

```
